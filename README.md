I undertook a data science project focused on hypothesis testing to analyze various business scenarios and draw statistical inferences. The project involved four distinct problem statements, each requiring hypothesis testing techniques to derive meaningful insights. Here's a brief overview of the project:
 
Problem Statements:
 
1. Cutlet Diameter Analysis:
 A Food and Beverage (F&B) manager aimed to determine whether there exists a significant difference in the diameter of cutlets between two production units. Random samples of cutlets were collected from both units and measured. The analysis involved conducting hypothesis tests to ascertain if any statistically significant differences exist between the units' cutlet diameters.
 
2. Laboratory Turn Around Time (TAT) Investigation:
 A hospital sought to ascertain whether there is a variation in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports among laboratories on their preferred list. A random sample of reports from four different laboratories was collected and their TAT recorded. Through hypothesis testing, the aim was to determine if there are significant differences in TAT among the laboratories.
 
3. Regional Sales Analysis:
 The project involved examining the sales of products across four different regions categorized by gender. The objective was to determine if the male-to-female buyer ratios were consistent across regions. Hypothesis testing methods were employed to evaluate the similarity of buyer ratios across the regions.
 
4. Customer Order Form Error Analysis:
 TeleCall, a global company with four processing centers worldwide, aimed to investigate if the percentage of defective customer order forms varied across centers. An audit of a certain percentage of order forms was conducted, and any errors rendered the form defective, necessitating rework. Through hypothesis testing, the project aimed to help the management discern if there were significant differences in defective percentages among the centers.
